# Getting a Feel for Audio in Ableton Live

At around 11 or 12 years old, I recognised that I had a choice to make about whether to go down the respective rabbit holes of computing or of music. I chose the former, which has worked out well for my career prospects, but it's been at the expense of my experience with the latter.

I have a decent ear for music - I know what music I like, I know what sounds good and what doesn't, and I have grade 1- or 2-level experience with the piano - but up until recently I had no experience whatsoever with how competent professionals made music or managed audio in the modern day. Eventually, after having been inspired by listening to notable drum & bass artists for the last couple of years, I shelled out for the fully-featured version of Ableton Live.

These pages document my experimentations in this realm, and useful things I've come to learn that I want to record somewhere permanent.
