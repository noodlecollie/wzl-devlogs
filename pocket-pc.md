# Compiling for Pocket PC

During the 2020 coronavirus lockdown, I bought some old Pocket PC-based mobile devices off eBay for a bit of fun, and wanted to see whether I could get them to run my own programs. This page details my explorations into this.

## Devices

The two devices I bought are:

### HTC Advantage X7500

£45. Who needs an iPad Pro when you have one of these?

### O2 XDA Stellar

£7.99. Listed as spares/repairs because the seller didn't have the cables or sync software, but it turns out it works just fine. Bargain.
